    `  "summary": "## Financial Data Analysis Summary\\n\\nThis analysis is based on a small dataset of three employees. Due to the limited size, insights should be interpreted cautiously and further analysis with a larger dataset is recommended.\\n\\n**Trends & Insights:**\\n\\n*   **Departmental Salary Variation:** Salaries appear to differ across departments. Engineering has the highest salary at $75,000, followed by Marketing at $62,000, and Sales at $50,000.\\n*   **Age and Salary:** A positive correlation between age and salary is suggested, with older employees generally earning more. Bob, at 34, earns the most, while Alice, at 28, earns the least. Charlie, at 25, earns more than Alice even though he is younger.\\n\\n**Anomalies:**\\n\\n*   With such limited data, identifying true anomalies is difficult. However, the data point of Charlie earning more than Alice despite being younger could be investigated further in a larger dataset. Factors like experience level or specific roles within the departments might explain this.\\n\\n**Patterns:**\\n\\n*   The small dataset hints at a potential relationship between department and salary, and age and salary.  However, more data is needed to confirm these patterns.\\n\\n## Actionable Recommendations\\n\\n1.  **Expand the Dataset:** Gather data on more employees to obtain a more representative sample and increase the statistical significance of the analysis.\\n2.  **Investigate Departmental Salary Differences:**  Explore the reasons behind salary variations between departments. Consider factors like required skills, experience levels, and market demand for specific roles.\\n3.  **Analyze Compensation Structure:** Examine the company's compensation structure to ensure fair and equitable pay across all departments and experience levels. This should include detailed salary bands for each role.\\n4.  **Monitor Age and Salary Trends:** Continuously monitor the relationship between age and salary to identify potential age-related pay disparities.\\n",\n` +
